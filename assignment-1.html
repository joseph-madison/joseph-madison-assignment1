                Our science-first approach creates music that sounds<br>
                different-and affects your brain differently-than any other<br> music.

            <p5>
                Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to
                elicit strong neural phase locking-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of
                coordinated activity-and technology to
                remove c straction in sound.<br>
                This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words,
                we've found new wavs to create music that helps you do what you need to do.

            <p7>
                Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.<br>
                We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using MRI and EEG, and also run
                large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.<br>
                Our experiments always include a control conelton (placebo) of the same underlying music without
                Brain.fm
                technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes
                the difference.
